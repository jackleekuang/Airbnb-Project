## Project Overview

This collaborative project, conducted with [Jeco Cheung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jecocheung/) & [Weber Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weber-tsungwei-lin/) as part of the DSO 574 course at the University of Southern California, offers high-level insights into the online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays by analyzing Airbnb data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in major Los Angeles areas.
